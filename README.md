# PyZX Scripts

This is code I use for doing experiments and benchmarking based on the quantum circuit optimisation library [PyZX](https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx).

Since it is designed to run on a multi-user compute server, long computations are set up to run via [PBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System).
